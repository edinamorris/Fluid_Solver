# SPH 3D Real-Time Fluid Simulation #

![Fluid Image](http://www.saeedmahani.com/images/fluid1.png)

For our final project in Theodore Kim's Physics-Based Simulation class (Winter '12) we were asked to implement a large, non-trivial technique. My project is based on Matthias Müller's (et al.) research of applying Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to fluid simulation - essentially simulating fluid as thousands of small particles, rather than the traditional Eularian grid-based approach.

Feel free to email me and I'll tell you more about this project!

## Using the Simulator ##

Firstly, click & drag to rotate the scene using typical GLVU camera controls. You'll notice the simulation starts in a stopped state - you'll need to toggle the animation ON. Below are some keyboard controls.

### Basic Controls ###

a -- Toggle the physics animation on/off (upon starting animation is OFF)  
1 -- Load the "Dam Break" scenario (initial scenario)  
2 -- Load the "Cube" scenario  
3 -- Load the "Faucet" scenario  
t -- Toggle tumble mode on/off (the water will react to the tilt of the camera)  

### Advanced Controls ##
  
g -- Toggle grid visible (grid used for neighbor particle optimization)  
/ -- Toggle gravity on/off  
s -- Toggle coloring of surface purple (particles on the surface have a surface tension force applied)  
f -- Output current FPS to stdout
